description: This endpoint allows users to delete an existing brought forward loss. The user should be aware that where a loss has been used as part of a successful crystallisation activity, deletion will be blocked and an error code will be returned. In such a case, the user can amend the loss amount to zero. If the user wants to delete any details, they need to create a new account for that business.
