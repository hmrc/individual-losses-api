These resources allow software packages to provide a taxpayers' financial data for their brought forward losses.
Here the developer can:
 
* provide a list of brought forward losses
* create a new brought forward loss to submit against Self-employment, Self-employment class 4, UK FHL property and UK other (Non-FHL) property
* show a single brought forward loss
* delete an existing brought forward loss
* update an existing brought forward loss
