This is an example API that allows software developers to test that 
their applications can connect with the HMRC API Platform. It also acts 
as a hands-on tutorial for developers to get started with HMRC APIs.

It includes resources for testing access to the three different access 
levels:

- _Say hello world_ is an example of an unrestricted endpoint
- _Say hello user_ is an example of a user-restricted endpoint
- _Say hello application_ is an example of an application-restricted endpoint

Further details of the different access levels are given on the 
[Authorisation](/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, 
see [Tutorials](/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).
