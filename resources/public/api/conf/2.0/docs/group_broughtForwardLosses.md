Here the developer can:
 
* Provide a list of brought forward losses
* Create a new brought forward loss to submit against Self-employment, Self-employment class 4, UK FHL property and UK other (Non-FHL) property
* Show a single brought forward loss
* Delete an existing brought forward loss
* Update an existing brought forward loss
